### How To Use:
---

Functionality is similar to any calculator.  
- Click in the first number or series of number in the calculations
- Click on the operator or operation you wish to perform
- Click on the second number you wish to include
- Continue process for as many numbers and operations as you wish
- Click the "=" sign. 
- View the answer.

### This project demonstrates the following:
---

- [x] create a HTML and JavaScript calculator.
- [x] perform math on multiple integers.
- [x] handle operations from simple arithmatic to advanced functions like sin, cos, tan, √, ∛, π, a<sup>3</sup>.
- [x] functionality to switch between radian and degrees for all sin, cos, and tan equations.
- [x] a button with the equals sign.
- [x] buttons for numbers 0-9.
- [x] buttons for the following operators (+, -, /, *, sin, cos, tan, √, ∛, π, a<sup>3</sup> ), 

### Ways I challenged myself

So when you are beginning to learn any new skill, as you start to learn more and more things you get excited about the all the incredible new things you can do.  And sometimes those things are eclectic, almost disparate.  But your enthusiasm pushes you to reach out in several directions at once.  This is kind of what happened here.  While working with a project designed to create something very functional using very functional JavaScript, I suddenly got an idea wondering if I could use JavaScript to create an array of photos which could be played as screensavers.  It had absolutely nothing to do with the current project, but my enthusiasm won out, so I created the only calculator that comes complete with a screen-saver.  But in the process I learnd how to do the following: 

- [x] create a desktop screen saver effect using multiple layers of CSS.
- [x] use z-index, knowledge of positioning and layering, and animation transitions to make the scenes fade in and out in regularly timed intervals.
- [x] create an array of objects referencing multiple photos.
- [x] refactor hard coded CSS and replaced it with JavaScript functionality to iterate through the arrays in the animation process.
- [x] refactor so that the array of pictures could be modified into and array of theme objects, with each theme containing pictures that can be interated through.
- [x] create JavaScript functionality that allows a user to select a theme, which then alters the CSS according to event handlers.
- [x] add JavaScript pause functionality for the animation to help increase 508 compliance.
