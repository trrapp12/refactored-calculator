### Rules of the Game:
---

1. The app starts by choosing a random word
2. The player can guess a single letter at a time
3. The player has a fixed number of turns in which to guess all of the letters in the word
4. The app should indicate when the player has won or lost

### This project demonstrates the following:
---

- [x] create a HTML and JavaScript calculator.
- [x] perform math on multiple integers.
- [x] handle operations from simple arithmatic to advanced functions like sin, cos, tan, √, ∛, π, a<sup>3</sup>.
- [x] functionality to switch between radian and degrees for all sin, cos, and tan equations.
- [x] a button with the equals sign.
- [x] buttons for numbers 0-9.
- [x] buttons for the following operators (+, -, /, *, sin, cos, tan, √, ∛, π, a<sup>3</sup> ),

- [x] created a desktop screen saver effect using multiple layers of CSS.
- [x] use z-index, knowledge of positioning and layering, and animation transitions to make the scenes fade in and out in regularly timed intervals.
- [x] create an array of objects referencing multiple photos.
- [x] refactor hard coded CSS and replaced it with JavaScript functionality to iterate through the arrays in the animation process.
- [x] refactor so that the array of pictures could be modified into and array of theme objects, with each theme containing pictures that can be interated through.
- [x] create JavaScript functionality that allows a user to select a theme, which then alters the CSS according to event handlers.
- [x] added JavaScript pause functionality for the animation to help increase 508 compliance.
